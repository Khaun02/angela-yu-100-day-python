# 100 Days of Python – Angela Yu Course Progress

This repository documents my personal journey through Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: Python" course. Each folder represents a day's challenge or project, and I’ve been customizing and modifying files as needed for my workflow.

## 🎯 Purpose
To build a strong foundation in Python programming and keep track of my learning progress. I'm adapting course materials as I go and learning by doing, not just watching.

## 📁 Structure
- The repository is organized by day (e.g., `day001`, `day002`, etc.)
- Some project files may be modified based on my setup and learning pace

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3

(Note: I may explore additional tools and libraries as the course progresses.)

## 🚀 Getting Started
No special setup required. You can simply clone this repo and browse the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khaun02/angela-yu-100-day-python.git
```

Feel free to explore how I'm approaching each day of the challenge.

## 🧠 Future Plans
Once I complete larger or more complex projects later in the course, I may deploy or feature them online. For now, this serves as my sandbox for learning.
