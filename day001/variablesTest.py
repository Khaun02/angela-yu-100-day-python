# variable lesson

# assigns whatever the user typed into this prompt, called name, variable

    # name = input("What is your name?")
    # print(name)

# challenge 1) using what you have learnt about the len() function and the input() function.  Try to print out the number of characters in the user input. Write everything in just 1 line of code.

    # didn't know how to solve so had to google "pythn len() function"

        #name = input("What is your name?")
        #print(len(name))

# challenge 2) split all into variables

name = input("What is your name?")
nameLength = len(name)
print(f"Your name has {nameLength} characters")
